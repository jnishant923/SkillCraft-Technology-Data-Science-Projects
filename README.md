## 🔹 Task 01: Population Distribution Visualization
**Objective:**  
Visualize the distribution of population across different age groups using a bar chart.

**Dataset:**  
Population data (India – 2022)

**Tool Used:**  
- Power BI

**Key Insights:**  
- Majority of the population lies in the 21–64 age group  
- India has a strong working-age population  
- Elderly population is comparatively smaller

## 🔹 Task 02: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)
**Objective:**  
Perform data cleaning and EDA to identify patterns and relationships in survival data.

**Dataset:**  
Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)

**Tools Used:**  
- Power BI

**Steps Performed:**  
- Handled missing values (Age → Median, Embarked → Mode)  
- Removed irrelevant columns  
- Created visualizations for survival analysis

**Key Insights:**  
- Females had a higher survival rate than males  
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive  
- Passenger class and gender strongly influenced survival
